# DSC++ Examples

- `binary_search.cpp` – Iterative and recursive binary search over sorted vectors, showing how the search interval shrinks in logarithmic time.
- `bst_unique.cpp` – Binary search tree storing unique keys with insert/search/delete plus traversal demonstrations.
- `bst_with_duplicates.cpp` – BST variant that counts duplicates per node to behave like a multiset while supporting removal modes.
- `combinations.cpp` – Recursive backtracking generator that prints all k-sized combinations of a base set.
- `graph_traversal.cpp` – Adjacency-list graph with iterative DFS and BFS showcasing depth-first vs breadth-first ordering.
- `hash_map.cpp` – Open-addressed hash map with linear probing, including rehashing and basic CRUD operations.
- `linked_list.cpp` – Singly linked list supporting head/tail insertions, targeted insertion/removal, and pretty-printing.
- `merge_sort.cpp` – In-place merge sort implementation using a scratch buffer to demonstrate divide-and-conquer sorting.
- `min_max_heap.cpp` – Min-max heap supporting efficient access/extraction for both minimum and maximum priorities.
- `permutations.cpp` – In-place backtracking routine that enumerates every permutation of a small integer vector.
- `queue.cpp` – Dynamically growing circular-buffer queue with enqueue/dequeue/front operations and usage demo.
- `recursive_parser.cpp` – Recursive descent parser and evaluator for basic arithmetic expressions.
- `stack.cpp` – Dynamically resizing array-backed stack with push/pop/peek and error handling for underflow.
- `subsets.cpp` – Power-set generator that recursively explores include/exclude decisions for each input element.
